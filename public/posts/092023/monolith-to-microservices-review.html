                    (Review) Monolith to Microservices: Evolutionary Patterns to Transform Your Monolith - Sam Newman
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The book starts away bringing core keywords about microservices: what they are, how they are supposed to
                    behave, what is the cost of having different applications inside the same business aggregate and other important
                    matters. Along the book's chapters it is possible to perceive that the author tries to not keep any opinion,
                    bringing only the overall and explaining a bit about some patterns that can be used in each step of the migration
                    from a coupled monolith to a fully functional microservices architecture. 
                </p>

                <h2>Just Enough Microservices</h2>
                <p>
                    The fist chapter, <b>Just Enough Microservices</b> brings a overall of the thoughts strictly needed before deciding
                    if microservices are the solution to the problems that the reader is having, but the chapter itself tries to explain 
                    how different architectures are designed and how the teams arrangement will affect directly in this design. After some 
                    pages of an extended and not very necessary explanation about that we get a very superficial description about performance
                    and conflict problems that was not very satisfactory and had a lack of real world examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About profitable spots of this chapter, it is not failing in parts like explaining key terms, like coupling/decoupling and
                    the relationship with advantages and disvantages, talking about how a monolith can be profitable in applications that are
                    new to the market and a satisfactory overwview about domain driven design. With that, the reader gracefully ends the chapter
                    knowing a satisfactory amount about domain driven designs and with a basic view to identify that in real world cases.
                </p>
