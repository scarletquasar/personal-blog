            <h1>About me</h1>
        
            <p>
              Hello. My name is Scarlet Victoria Rose, but I usually go for only Scarlet or Victoria. I am a
              software developer with <b>7+</b> years of hands on experience with software development,
              architecture, leadership and product development from zero to deployment. During my experience time
              I have dealt with a lot of different situations - I've worked in 3 different fintechs, one bank, an
              ERP application, a radiation management device ecosystem and much more.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              My passion is to create tooling and libraries, I am an active open-source contributor in my free time and 
              very interested in matters like natural language processing, graph discovery and manipulation algorithms,
              utility-focused web crawling and automation. I've been coding since I was 12 and I see the development work
              as a thing that I want to do for my life.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              My technical background is huge - I had to deal with several languages in my carreer, the most remarkable
              ones were: C#, F#, Golang, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, Zig, C/C++ and a little of Erlang.
              I am also an academic person, got a technology bachelor's degree in Information Systems
              in 2022 and I'm going for a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering with ending prevision for 2027. After that,
              my objectives are getting a master's degree and in a long term future, a PhD in mathematics.
            </p>
        
            <h1 class="work-title">My work</h1>
        
            <p>
              Currently, as previously mentioned, I work in a lot of different things a time. I like to write 
              (articles, books, documentation...), contribute in open-source projects and participate in lectures and programming
              communities.
            </p>
